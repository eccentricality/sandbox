## Universal rule when stuck
When progress stalls, the highest-ROI fixes are usually:
1) Fix the bottleneck (accuracy/damage/survivability/money) using the *lowest-effort multiplier*
2) Improve account-wide multipliers (systems that affect all characters)
3) Establish a consistent daily loop (small actions that compound)

## W1–W2: Foundations
### Minimum viable goals
- Establish a daily loop (even a 10–15 min one)
- Get basic account-wide upgrades started (stamps, early alchemy if available, etc.)
- Keep the main pusher improving while other characters contribute materials

### Common bottlenecks
- Accuracy (can’t hit reliably)
- Damage (kills too slow)
- Not enough money for upgrades

### If stuck
- Ask: “Is it accuracy or damage?”
- Fix accuracy first if hit chance is low.
- If money is the issue: recommend a short targeted farming plan + upgrading the most efficient money multipliers.

## W3–W4: System expansion
### Minimum viable goals
- Start prioritizing account-wide systems that scale (e.g., alchemy, stamps, post office, construction/worship depending on unlocks)
- Improve “daily cadence”: a small set of repeatable upgrades each day

### Common bottlenecks
- Split focus (too many systems, none leveled)
- Damage scaling feels flat (needs multipliers, not small upgrades)

### If stuck
- Ask which system is most neglected.
- Recommend 1–2 systems to focus for 7 days rather than “a little of everything”.

## W5–W6: Compounding multipliers
### Minimum viable goals
- Transition from “single character carry” to “account multipliers carry”
- Ensure each character has a role (pusher, farmer, materials, support)

### Common bottlenecks
- Accuracy becomes a wall again on new zones
- Upgrade costs spike (money/materials)
- Daily systems become mandatory for progress pace

### If stuck
- Ask: “What’s the hit chance and kill speed like?”
- Provide a “two-track plan”: (A) immediate push support, (B) account scaling daily loop.

## W7+: Endgame pattern
### Minimum viable goals
- Optimize time use: fewer, higher-impact tasks
- Focus on the biggest multipliers and ignore low-value micromanagement
- Build a weekly plan (not just daily)

### Common bottlenecks
- Overwhelm (too many systems)
- Suboptimal routing (doing lots of tasks with low return)

### If stuck
- Offer a “low-overwhelm” mode: 3 daily actions + 2 weekly actions.
- Ask the user which 2 systems they enjoy; tailor the plan so it’s sustainable.

## Routing guide (how the agent chooses advice)
- If the user says “stuck on a map”: prioritize ACCURACY/DAMAGE/SURVIVABILITY fixes first.
- If the user says “I don’t know what to do”: give the 3-tier plan + ask 3 intake questions.
- If the user says “alchemy is weak”: route to Alchemy checklist in 03_system_cheatsheets.md.
