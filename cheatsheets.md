> Each section has: what to ask the user, common mistakes, and a priority ladder.
> Keep advice actionable and tied to the user’s goal (push/damage/money/materials).

## A) Alchemy
### Ask (minimum)
- Do you have Alchemy unlocked? (Y/N)
- Rough level / how many bubbles/vials unlocked? (low/medium/high)
- What’s the goal: damage, money, materials, or pushing?

### Common mistakes
- Spreading upgrades too thin across many low-impact items
- Ignoring a daily cadence (small upgrades daily beat occasional big pushes)

### Priority ladder (generic, safe)
1) Keep a daily alchemy routine (even minimal)
2) Prioritize account-wide multipliers that affect your bottleneck (damage or money)
3) Only diversify after key multipliers are stable

## B) Stamps
### Ask
- Are stamps being upgraded daily/weekly? (Y/N)
- Is money the limiter? (Y/N)

### Common mistakes
- Upgrading too many stamps randomly instead of focusing on bottleneck-related stamps

### Priority ladder
1) Upgrade the few stamps tied to your bottleneck
2) If money is tight, create a short money session plan, then reinvest into stamps

## C) Post Office
### Ask
- Is Post Office unlocked? (Y/N)
- Do you do it daily/weekly? (Y/N)

### Priority ladder
1) Consistency (small, frequent progress)
2) Focus upgrades that support your goal (push/damage/money/materials)

## D) Talents / Star Talents
### Ask
- Do you feel “damage scaling” is flat? (Y/N)
- Are you missing talent points / key talent milestones? (Not sure/Yes/No)

### Priority ladder
1) Ensure your main pusher has the core damage/utility talent setup
2) Ensure secondary chars aren’t completely neglected (they fuel account systems)

## E) Cards
### Ask
- Do you have a “push set” vs “farm set”? (Y/N)
- Are you upgrading cards at all? (Y/N)

### Priority ladder
1) Use the right set for the right activity
2) Upgrade a small number of high-impact cards rather than many tiny upgrades

## F) Star Signs
### Ask
- Are star signs actively equipped/managed? (Y/N)
- Are you focusing on pushing or skilling?

### Priority ladder
1) Ensure signs match activity
2) Improve them when it directly supports your bottleneck

## G) Construction
### Ask
- Unlocked? (Y/N)
- Are you doing it consistently? (Y/N)

### Priority ladder
1) Keep construction always progressing
2) Prioritize account multipliers over niche upgrades until stable

## H) Worship
### Ask
- Unlocked? (Y/N)
- Are you collecting/using worship gains regularly? (Y/N)

### Priority ladder
1) Consistency
2) Improve what supports your current bottleneck

## I) Cooking / Lab / Breeding / Divinity / Sailing / Gaming / Rift / Sneaking
For each:
### Ask
- Unlocked? (Y/N)
- What’s the rough level/unlocks? (low/med/high)
- What’s your goal (push/damage/money/materials)?

### Priority ladder (generic)
1) Make it part of a sustainable routine (daily or weekly)
2) Focus on upgrades that multiply account-wide output
3) Avoid micromanagement until the foundations are strong

## “Low-overwhelm mode” (when the user is overloaded)
Daily (10–15 min):
- 1 account-wide upgrade action
- 1 bottleneck-related upgrade action
- 1 resource routing action

Weekly (30–60 min):
- Re-evaluate bottleneck
- Reassign characters to match the bottleneck

## Output rules for the agent
- Always connect steps to user’s stated problem.
- If uncertain about specifics, ask 1 question rather than guessing.
- Provide next actions as checkboxes whenever possible.
